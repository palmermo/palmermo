I enjoy creating dynamic and engaging learning communities through software development. I have a background in teaching with a masters degree in Educational Leadership. My other interests include finding ways to optimzie user experiences through analyzing user behavior data. I am currently learning about recommender systems and ways to increase network effects. 

Here is my 2020 reading list so far:

* The Lean Product Playbook
* The Platform Revolution
* Storytelling with Data
